# TIC-report-march
In this project I analysed TIC attendance in the month of march

TIC (Tourist Information Center) is located in Tver, created by social project "The Rails". Ð¨ts purpose is to help locals and visitors better get acquainted with the city and region, learn about interesting places, go on excursions, buy souvenirs. TIC keeps track of attendance using Google Sheets. My task was to analyze the data for March, answer some questions from management.
This is a unique dataset that was received from TIC.
My goal in this project is to analyze some information, answer a bunch of question and, of course, improve my skills in data analytics.
