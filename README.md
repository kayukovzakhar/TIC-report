# TIC-report
In this project I am analysing TIC attendance from the month of march 2024

TIC (Tourist Information Center) is located in Tver, created by social project "The Rails" ([therails.cc](https://therails.cc/)). Its purpose is to help locals and visitors better get acquainted with the city and region, learn about interesting places and visit them, go on excursions, buy souvenirs. TIC keeps track of attendance using Google Sheets. My task was to analyze the data for March, answer some questions from management.
This is a unique dataset that was received from TIC.
My goal in this project is to analyze some information, answer a bunch of question and, of course, improve my skills in data analytics.
# Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets
# Collect data from Google.Sheets and convert it to .csv
Here is a peak on how data looks for most of the TIC-crew:

I had to download it in .xlxs format, combine all 31 sheets and convert it to .csv format. Here is how it looks:

# Conclusion
It was my first time working with Pandas and Matplotlib, and also it was my first time doing some data analysis. 

In process I learned a lot of different things, starting with how to combine sheets in Excel table and convert it to .csv, following with how to correctly clean data, work with Pandas dataframes (filter them, create new, do something with columns, rows and values) and ending with how to visualise data using Matplotlib.

Overall, it was a great expirience for me! Hope you well enjoyed and until next time!
